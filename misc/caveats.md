# Caveats

This repository may include some binaries, for practical purposes.
We therefore provide checksums, some of which might not be official. 
We would like to include the official ones, but sometimes they are not
available. The checksum we provide is only to ensure that the version 
that you downloaded corresponds to the one we have.

## /bin/ORFfinder
This will only work on linux\_x64, [as stated on NCBI's website](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/orffinder/).
Regretably, the NCBI does not provide any kind of checksum for verifying the integrity of said binary.
We computed md5 and sha256 sums for the binary we downloaded and provide with this repo.
